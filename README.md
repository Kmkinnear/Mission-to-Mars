# Mission-to-Mars

1.  How many months exist on Mars? - I decided to count how many unique numbers were in the month column and came up with 12 which leads me to believe there are 12 months.

2.  How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset? - I used the same approach as question 1 and decided to count how many sols (Martian Days) worth of data that existed

3.  What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? Get the answer by averaging the minimum daily temperature of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart. - First I decided to group the data together by "Month" to get the average minimum daily temperature by month. Then I plotted the results in a bar chart. By looking at the data we can see that Month 3 is the coldest (-83.307292) and Month 8 is the warmest (-68.382979)

4.  Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Get the answer by averaging the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months. Plot the results as a bar chart. - I decided to use the same approach as question 3 and grouped the data together by "Month". Then I focused on the daily atmospheric pressure column and got the averages. Then we displayed the data as a bar chart. From the data we can see that Month 6 has the lowest (745.054422) pressure and Month 9 has the highest (913.305970) pressure
